Looking ahead, our research aims to develop interpretable biological foundation models, with a focus on antigen presentation and RNA isoform regulation at single-cell resolution. Moving beyond traditional gene-centric approaches, we explore isoform-level expression as a fundamental representation to characterize cell types, cellular states, and their spatiotemporal dynamics. This perspective enables a more precise and mechanistic understanding of cellular regulation.

By integrating multi-omics data, single-cell technologies, and AI-driven modeling, we seek to construct RNA-centric gene regulatory networks that address key limitations of existing biological foundation models, particularly in interpretability and regulatory resolution. Ultimately, our work aims to advance the quantitative understanding of living systems and to support the rational design of biological processes for applications in biomedicine and beyond.
