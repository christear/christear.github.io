  description: With the fast-growing and evolving omics data, the demand for streamlined and adaptable tools to handle bioinformatics analysis continues to grow. In response to this need, Automated Bioinformatics Analysis (AutoBA) is introduced, an autonomous AI agent designed explicitly for fully automated multi-omic analyses based on large language models (LLMs).

  description: Most mammalian genes generate messenger RNAs with variable untranslated regions (UTRs) that are important post-transcriptional regulators. In cancer, shortening at 3′ UTR ends via alternative polyadenylation can activate oncogenes. However, internal 3′ UTR splicing remains poorly understood as splicing studies have traditionally focused on protein-coding alterations.

  description: Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the second leading cause of cancer deaths globally. In recent years, short-read single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been instrumental in deciphering tumor heterogeneities. However, these studies only enable gene-level quantification but neglect alterations in transcript structures arising from alternative end processing or splicing. In this study, we integrated short- and long-read scRNA-seq of CRC samples to build an isoform-resolution CRC transcriptomic atlas.

  description: Mammals tightly regulate their core body temperature, yet how cells sense and respond to small temperature changes remains incompletely understood. Here, we discover RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) as key thermosensors enriched near splice sites of cold-repressed exons. These thermosensing RNA structures, when stabilized, mask splice sites, reducing exon inclusion.

  description: Alternative polyadenylation (APA) enables a gene to generate multiple transcripts with different 3′ ends, which is dynamic across different cell types or conditions. Many computational methods have been developed to characterize sample-specific APA using the corresponding RNA-seq data, but suffered from high error rate on both polyadenylation site (PAS) identification and quantification of PAS usage (PAU), and bias toward 3′ untranslated regions. Here we developed a tool for APA identification and quantification (APAIQ) from RNA-seq data, which can accurately identify PAS and quantify PAU in a transcriptome-wide manner.
