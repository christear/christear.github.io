  description: With the fast-growing and evolving omics data, the demand for streamlined
    and adaptable tools to handle bioinformatics analysis continues to grow. In response
    to this need, Automated Bioinformatics Analysis (AutoBA) is introduced, an autonomous
    AI agent designed explicitly for fully automated multi-omic analyses based on
    large language models (LLMs).
