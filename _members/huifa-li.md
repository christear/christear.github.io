Huifa Li is a research engineer working at the intersection of artificial intelligence and single-cell biology. My research focuses on developing AI-driven methods for single-cell data analysis, with an emphasis on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs).

I aim to leverage graph-based representations and foundation models to address a wide range of challenges in single-cell analysis, including cellular heterogeneity, cell–cell interactions, and multi-modal data integration. By bridging advanced machine learning techniques with single-cell genomics, my work seeks to provide scalable, interpretable, and biologically meaningful solutions for understanding complex cellular systems.
