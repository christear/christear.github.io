Professor Zhang focuses on addressing the challenge of discovering novel biological patterns from large-scale omics data by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced computational methods. His research aims to develop innovative omics analysis tools and construct comprehensive databases and atlases to uncover gene regulatory mechanisms associated with diseases such as cancer and genetic disorders, with a particular emphasis on RNA regulation.
