Our laboratory focuses on AI for systems biology, leveraging deep learning–based methods to model complex biological processes such as gene regulation and antigen presentation. Our goal is to facilitate the discovery of novel biological phenomena, identify putative drug targets, develop innovative therapeutic strategies, and improve disease diagnostics.

Our research spans, but is not limited to, several major directions, including single-cell modeling, multi-omics integration, and foundation models for biological processes that involve interactions among multiple macromolecules. In addition, our group actively contributes to major university flagship projects, including the Human Phenotype Project (HPP) and the Emirates Genome Project (EGP).
