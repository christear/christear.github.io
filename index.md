Our laboratory focuses on AI for Science (AI4Science), with a particular emphasis on omics-oriented research. We aim to integrate advanced artificial intelligence techniques with high-throughput omics data to enable data-driven discovery in life sciences and biomedicine.

By leveraging large-scale biological datasets, we seek to uncover the underlying principles of complex biological systems and contribute to precision medicine and mechanistic understanding.
